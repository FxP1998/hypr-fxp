<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm FxP</h1>
<h3 align="center">A normal man from INDIA, who loves to use Arch Linux recently shifted from Windows (F*** you Windows). Currently trying to configure my own Hyperland setup for low-end devices because I have only 2Ghz of processor so that others can also use those who have a potato device like mine :)</h3>
